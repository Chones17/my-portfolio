          I am a technical program manager and full-stack engineer with a
          passion for building scalable systems and leading cross-functional
          teams to deliver real-world impact. With a background that spans
          software development, IT infrastructure, and operational leadership, I
          bring a unique ability to bridge the gap between business objectives
          and technical execution. I have led projects from MVP to production,
          managed over 150 professionals in prior leadership roles, and
          contributed hands-on to applications built with React, Next.js,
          Node.js, and FastAPI. Whether I am optimizing workflows, architecting
          backend systems, or aligning stakeholders around a shared goal, I am
          driven by clarity, collaboration, and continuous improvement. I am
          currently seeking full-time opportunities where I can contribute both
          as a builder and a leader.
